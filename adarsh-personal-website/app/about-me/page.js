      About me
      <br />
      <br />
      I'm a UX designer based in Kerala, India, pursuing a degree in Computer
      Science and Engineering at Government Engineering College Thrissur,
      graduating in 2025. Although my journey began in frontend web development,
      I soon uncovered a profound passion for shaping user-centric interfaces,
      prompting my shift into UX design. My fulfillment comes from crafting
      intuitive and captivating user experiences.

          Hello! I'm Adarsh, a UX designer from a small village in Kerala,

        <p>
          I started off with frontend web development, and then switched to UI
          design. I've found that I really enjoy designing user centric
          interfaces rather than coding.
