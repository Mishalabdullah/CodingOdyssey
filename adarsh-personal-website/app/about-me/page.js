          Hello! I'm Adarsh, a UX designer from a small village in Kerala,
          India. I'm currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at
          Government Engineering College Thrissur.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started off with frontend web development, and then switched to UI
          design. I've found that I really enjoy designing user centric
          interfaces rather than coding.
